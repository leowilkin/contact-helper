# Hack Club Contact Helper
Pass URL variables of Slack profile link and MAILTO link and get a nice page! Built for @hackclub International poster thingym'bob

## How to use
If you're on Airtable, make a button or a formula to pass the user's name (optional), email and slack link (formatted like this: https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U07BLJ1MBEE) into a link like this:

<code>/?slack=https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U07BLJ1MBEE&email=leow@hackclub.com&name=Leo</code>

## Some good bits
It will conditionally show platform buttons depending on what variables you pass it, and it knows what a valid Slack ID looks like!
